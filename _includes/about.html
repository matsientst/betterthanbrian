                    <p>You know Brian. We all know Brian. Brian's the guy who insists he can build your website over a weekend with a six-pack and a dream. Sure, he can fix your printer, but when it comes to crafting a compelling brand identity or launching a digital campaign? Let's just say, you're better off with us.</p>
                    <p>But Brian knows jack about web development. He knows even less about digital advertising, seo, and most of the things that make a web presence successful. Not knowing doesn’t stop Brian from trying. He thinks winging it will help. (It won’t.) <strong>Brian’s not a bad guy - he’s just bad for business</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Don’t let Brian wing it with your budget dollars. <em>You can do better than Brian</em>.</p>
                    <p><strong>You need a team with all of Brian’s lost potential</strong>. While Brian’s curiosity ends with code, our team's curiosity never ends. We’re Web Development experts who know about all the things Brian doesn’t, like what strategies go into marketing a business and the art of advertising. We do <strong>way more</strong> than fix backend code and troubleshoot website problems. </p>
                    <p>It’s time to take your website to the next level. <strong>You deserve better than Brian</strong>!</p>
