<h4>"I Saved Money!"... And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves</h4>
<h5>Why that $500 website actually cost you $5,000 in lost opportunities</h5>
<p>We get it. That Fiverr gig or your Brian's "I know HTML" offer seemed like a steal. But like a $5 sushi buffet, <strong>cheap websites come with hidden costs</strong> &dash; lost clients, damaged credibility, and that sinking "I need to redo this" feeling.</p>

<h4>1. The "Free" Website That Costs You Clients</h4>
<p><strong>The Illusion:</strong> "I saved $3,000 by using Squarespace!"</p>

<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Your bounce rate is 90% because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mobile users get a broken mess</li>
  <li>Slow loading = Google demotes you</li>
  <li>Generic template = zero memorability</li>
</ul>
<br>

  <p>"Our client lost an estimated $18k in sales before redesigning their 'budget' site."</p>

<h4>2. The Nephew Special (And Why It Always Backfires)</h4>

<p><strong>Why "Brian from IT" isn't enough:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No strategy (just throwing features at the wall)</li>
  <li>Zero understanding of conversions</li>
  <li>Maintenance? "Uh... I'm at college now"</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Actual client horror story:</strong> Nephew-built sites often need complete rewrites within 6 months &dash; costing 2x what professional work would have.</p>
<br>
<h4>3. The Domino Effect of Cheap</h4>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>What You Saved</th>
        <th>What You Lost</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>$2,000 on design</td>
        <td>20% of potential sales (â‰ˆ$15k/year)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$500 on hosting</td>
        <td>3.2 sec load time â†’ 40% bounce rate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$0 on SEO</td>
        <td>Page 4 Google ranking (aka the abyss)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<h4>4. When "Cheap" Becomes "Expensive"</h4>
<p><strong>The Redesign Tax:</strong> Businesses who start cheap typically spend <em>47% more</em> fixing their site later (Source: Our client data). Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Migrating from messy code</li>
  <li>Rebranding to undo template damage</li>
  <li>Wasted time retraining teams</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>The Better Than Brian Difference</h4>

<p>We build sites that:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Convert</strong> visitors into customers</li>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Grow</strong> with your business</li>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Save money</strong> long-term (no redo's needed)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Pay once for quality, or pay forever fixing "cheap."</p>
