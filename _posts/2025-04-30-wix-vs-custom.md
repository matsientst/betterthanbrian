<h4>The DIY Illusion: When "Easy" Means "Embarrassing"</h4>
<h5>Why your Wix site might be costing you clients and credibility</h5>


<p>Wix markets itself as the "easy" solution. And sure, it's easy in the same way microwaving a frozen burrito is "cooking." But if you want a website that actually <em>works</em> for your business (instead of just existing), here's why "easy" often means <strong>"embarrassingly limited."</strong></p>

<h4>1. The Template Trap: Your Brand Deserves Better Than 'Stock Photo Chic'</h4>
<p><strong>Wix Problem:</strong> You're picking (let's be real, brian picked it) from the same 10 templates as every startup, bakery, and life coach in THE WORLD.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Advantage:</strong> We design around <em>your</em> brand &dash; not the other way around. No more awkwardly forcing your logo into Wix's pre-made color schemes.</p>

<h4>2. Speed Matters: Wix Sites Load Like your Mom's old Dial-Up Connection</h4>
<p><strong>Wix Problem:</strong> Bloated code + generic hosting = pages that load slower than a DMV line. (Google penalizes slow sites, by the way.)</p>

<p><strong>Custom Fix:</strong> Our sites average <strong>1.5-second load times</strong> because we:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize every image</li>
  <li>Write clean code (not Wix's spaghetti nonsense)</li>
  <li>Use premium hosting</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pro Tip:</em> Test your Wix site's speed at <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Then cry.</p>
<br>
<h4>3. SEO? More Like "See You On Page 5"</h4>
<p><strong>Wix Problem:</strong> Their "SEO Wizard" is about as magical as a carnival fortune teller. Try searching for "[your industry] + [your city]" &dash; see your Wix site? Didn't think so.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Solution:</strong> We build sites to rank, with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proper URL structures (no Wix's weird /#about nonsense)</li>
  <li>Fast performance (see #2)</li>
  <li><em>Actual</em> keyword strategy</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>4. "But I Need [Basic Feature]..." â†’ "LOL, Good Luck"</h4>
<p><strong>Wix's Dirty Secret:</strong> Need a custom booking system? Member portal? Even a simple email form that doesn't look like it's from 2004? Prepare for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Endless third-party app subscriptions</li>
  <li>"Workarounds" that break when Wix updates</li>
  <li>That sinking "why is this so hard?" feeling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We build <em>exactly</em> what you need. No hacks. No "upgrade to premium." Just functional solutions.</p>

<h4>5. The Hidden Cost of "Free"</h4>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Wix "Cheap" Option</th>
        <th>Custom (But Actually Worth It)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>$23/month forever</td>
        <td>One-time fee (you own it)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Template fees add up</td>
        <td>Unique design = no rebranding later</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Slow site = lost sales</td>
        <td>Fast site = more conversions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Time wasted fixing it</td>
        <td>Time saved = focus on your business</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h4>When Wix <em>Might</em> Be Okay (And When to Run)</h4>
<p>âœ… <strong>Use Wix if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You're a hobbyist</li>
  <li>Your budget is $0</li>
  <li>You enjoy shouting into the void</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>ðŸš« <strong>Upgrade to custom if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You run a real business</li>
  <li>You hate patching together 12 apps for basic features</li>
  <li>You'd rather <em>impress</em> clients than <em>embarrass</em> yourself</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Wix is like IKEA furniture &dash; fine for college, but you wouldn't put it in a luxury hotel.</p>
