<h4>Your website shouldn't be a compromise</h4>
<h5>Why "good enough" is costing you business</h5>


<p>Look, we get it. Squarespace is easy. It's like the TV dinner of websites &dash; quick, convenient, and profoundly sad when you burn the roof of your mouth off.</p>

<p>But here's the cold, hard truth: <strong>Your "good enough" website is probably costing you clients, credibility, and maybe even your will to live.</strong></p>

<p>Still not convinced? Here are five undeniable signs it's time to break up with Squarespace and upgrade to something that doesn't scream <em>"I Googled 'how to make a website' at 2 AM."</em></p>

<h4>1. Your Site Loads Slower Than Your Uncle Explaining NFTs</h4>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Squarespace sites are <em>notoriously</em> slow. Bloated code, unoptimized images, and server issues mean visitors bounce faster than Brian on a friday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> A custom-built site with optimized hosting (yes, we handle that too) loads in under 2 seconds &dash; because nobody has patience for your "artistic" loading animation.</p>

<h4>2. You've Tried to "Customize" It and Now It Looks Like your 2005 MySpace page</h4>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Squarespace promises "total design freedom," but let's be real &dash; you're still stuck picking from the same 12 templates as every yoga instructor and podcast host.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> A <em>real</em> designer builds a site that actually matches your brand (not just whatever font pairings Squarespace's algorithm barfed up).</p>

<h4>3. Your SEO Is Nonexistent (Just Like Brian's Follow-Up Emails)</h4>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Squarespace's SEO tools are about as effective as that hang in there kitty motivational poster. You're stuck on page 47 of Google, right between a grandma's site about needlepoint and a some felons mugshot.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Custom sites with clean code, fast load times, and <em>actual</em> SEO strategy (yes, we do that) rank higher. Crazy concept, right?</p>

<h4>4. You've Hit the "Oh man... This Feature Doesn't Exist" Wall</h4>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Need a custom booking system? Membership portal? Literally anything beyond a basic blog? LOL. Squarespace's answer: <em>"Here's a workaround involving 14 third-party apps and a prayer."</em></p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> A custom site does <em>exactly</em> what you need &dash; no duct tape and bubble gum needed.</p>

<h4>5. You're Embarrassed to Share Your Site Link</h4>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Deep down, you know your site looks like every other generic template out there. You cringe a little when clients ask for your URL.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> A professionally designed site makes you proud to hit <em>send</em> &dash; not ashamed to admit you built it yourself after three margaritas.</p>

  <p>"I used to waste hours fighting with Wix. Now I just... have a website that works. Magic. Jeez, those guys at Better Than Brian are good."  &dash;  Brian Wilson</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
<p>Squarespace is great... <strong>if you're okay with "meh."</strong> But if you want a site that:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Converts visitors into customers</strong></li>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Doesn't look like a template</strong></li>
  <li style="list-style:none">âœ… <strong>Actually works the way you need</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>...then it's time to upgrade.</p>
