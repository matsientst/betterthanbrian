<p>Over the last year I have had the opportunity to question how I build applications from many different perspectives and I'm sad to say that I've been doing it wrong...</p>
<p>I don't want it to sound like I'm a bad engineer or that I have built bad applications. That is not the case.</p>
<p> However, I have had an awakening that I've been building applications much as I did 15 years ago. There have been many changes to technologies and the tools that I use. But fundamentally, the architecture ideas that I was trained to use back in the day have still been my go to architectures. The processes that I used are much the same as we did when agile entered the scene. </p>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
